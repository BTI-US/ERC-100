Limitations
===========

While ERC-100 offers several advanced features and improvements over ERC-20, it also comes with certain limitations that developers and users should be aware of. These limitations include increased complexity, potential compatibility issues, and a steeper learning curve, among others.

- **Complexity**: Compared to ERC-20, ERC-100's logic is more complex, which may lead to higher gas costs.
- **Compatibility**: Existing ERC-20 tools and platforms may need adjustments to fully support ERC-100.
- **Adoption Rate**: As a new standard, ERC-100 may take time to be widely accepted by the community.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers familiar with ERC-20 may need additional time to understand and implement ERC-100.
- **Tooling Support**: Development tools and libraries may need updates to fully support ERC-100 features.
- **Security Risks**: The added complexity and new features may introduce potential security vulnerabilities that need to be carefully managed.
