Limitations
===========

While ERC-100 offers several advanced features and improvements over ERC-20, it also comes with certain limitations that developers and users should be aware of. These limitations include increased complexity, potential compatibility issues, and a steeper learning curve, among others.

- **Complexity**:  
  Compared to **ERC-20**, the logic behind **ERC-100** is more intricate, which may result in higher gas costs for transactions.
- **Compatibility**:  
  Existing **ERC-20** tools and platforms may require modifications to fully support the new **ERC-100** standard.
- **Adoption Rate**:  
  As a relatively new standard, **ERC-100** may face slow adoption and take time to gain widespread acceptance within the community.
- **Learning Curve**:  
  Developers familiar with **ERC-20** might encounter a steeper learning curve when transitioning to **ERC-100**, requiring additional time to master its intricacies.
- **Tooling Support**:  
  Development tools and libraries may need to be updated or adapted to fully support **ERC-100**'s enhanced features.
- **Security Risks**:  
  The increased complexity of **ERC-100** introduces potential security vulnerabilities, which must be carefully evaluated and mitigated to ensure robust implementation.
